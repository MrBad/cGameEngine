+ sprites should be able to set their UV coordinate (sprite animation)
~ add ability to draw strings on screen (using sprites?; cameraGetAABB and
    scale, so the text should be independent of zoom or camera position);
- add camera culling to the draw process; there is no need to draw all sprites
    but only the ones that camera sees (cameraGetAABB)
- does using lists in QuadTree for Objects, can speed up things?
    The objects moves inside tree, probably a list should be more appropiate.
